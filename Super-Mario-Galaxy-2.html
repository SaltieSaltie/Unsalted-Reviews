            <p class = "reviewParagraph">
                All Mario games have a pretty simple story and this game doesn't stray further from its predecessors; it actually sticks to the same exact formula as its prequel (Super Mario Galaxy). 
                 Peach has been captured, again, by Bowser because this giant turtle wants a huge cake.
                 That is all what the story about; short and sweet and Mario games don't need more than that.

            </p>
            <p class = "reviewParagraph">
                The main reason why Mario games don't need a convuluted story is because its gameplay is, dare I say, perfect.
                 The controls are simple but they are very fun and most importantly they are clean and responsive.
                 The whole game is divided in worlds, which are also divided in many galaxies that are built with amazing creativity and mind; you won't find boring galaxies.
                 The power-ups from Mario Galaxy make a return and then some more too!
                 All of the new power-ups are all enjoyable to use, especially the unique ones from the unique galaxies.

                This game is quite, 2010 old, but it holds up really well!
                 Due to Nintendo not concentrating on the actual graphics but on the 'cosmic' artsyle that dominates the game, it is a spectacle of an artwork.
                 Nintendo has really nailed the 'space aspect' of Super Mario Galaxy and that is what makes it the best Mario game of all time.
